# Event Manager Platform

A starter project for building an event management platform using **React** and **Vite**. This template provides a minimal layout to help you kick off feature development quickly.

## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: version 18 or later is recommended
- **npm** (bundled with Node.js) or **yarn**

Verify your Node.js version:

```powershell
node --version
```

Download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) if needed.

## 2. Install Dependencies

From the project root `c:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\my-apps\Event-Manager-paltform`, install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Or, if you prefer yarn:

```powershell
yarn install
```

## 3. Run the Development Server

Launch the development server with automatic reload:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

If using yarn:

```powershell
yarn dev
```

The terminal output typically shows the local URL (default `http://localhost:5173`).

## 4. Build for Production

Create an optimized production build:

```powershell
npm run build
```

To preview the production build locally:

```powershell
npm run preview
```

## 5. Project Structure (Initial)

```
src/
  App.jsx       # Root component with sample layout
  App.css       # Component styles
  main.jsx      # Vite entry point
```

Use this structure as a foundation to add pages, components, hooks, and utilities tailored to your event management needs.

## 6. Customization Tips

- **Styling**: Tailwind utility classes are included in the sample layout. Adjust or replace with your preferred styling approach.
- **Components**: Extend the `src/components` directory with reusable UI pieces.
- **Hooks**: Use `src/hooks` to organize custom logic such as data fetching or form handling.

Happy building!
